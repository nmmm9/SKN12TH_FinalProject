# Task ID: 41
# Title: Implement Visual Task Dependency Graph in Terminal
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a feature that renders task dependencies as a visual graph using ASCII/Unicode characters in the terminal, with color-coded nodes representing tasks and connecting lines showing dependency relationships.
# Details:
This implementation should include:

1. Create a new command `graph` or `visualize` that displays the dependency graph.

2. Design an ASCII/Unicode-based graph rendering system that:
   - Represents each task as a node with its ID and abbreviated title
   - Shows dependencies as directional lines between nodes (→, ↑, ↓, etc.)
   - Uses color coding for different task statuses (e.g., green for completed, yellow for in-progress, red for blocked)
   - Handles complex dependency chains with proper spacing and alignment

3. Implement layout algorithms to:
   - Minimize crossing lines for better readability
   - Properly space nodes to avoid overlapping
   - Support both vertical and horizontal graph orientations (as a configurable option)

4. Add detection and highlighting of circular dependencies with a distinct color/pattern

5. Include a legend explaining the color coding and symbols used

6. Ensure the graph is responsive to terminal width, with options to:
   - Automatically scale to fit the current terminal size
   - Allow zooming in/out of specific sections for large graphs
   - Support pagination or scrolling for very large dependency networks

7. Add options to filter the graph by:
   - Specific task IDs or ranges
   - Task status
   - Dependency depth (e.g., show only direct dependencies or N levels deep)

8. Ensure accessibility by using distinct patterns in addition to colors for users with color vision deficiencies

9. Optimize performance for projects with many tasks and complex dependency relationships

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test the graph generation algorithm with various dependency structures
   - Verify correct node placement and connection rendering
   - Test circular dependency detection
   - Verify color coding matches task statuses

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test the command with projects of varying sizes (small, medium, large)
   - Verify correct handling of different terminal sizes
   - Test all filtering options

3. Visual Verification:
   - Create test cases with predefined dependency structures and verify the visual output matches expected patterns
   - Test with terminals of different sizes, including very narrow terminals
   - Verify readability of complex graphs

4. Edge Cases:
   - Test with no dependencies (single nodes only)
   - Test with circular dependencies
   - Test with very deep dependency chains
   - Test with wide dependency networks (many parallel tasks)
   - Test with the maximum supported number of tasks

5. Usability Testing:
   - Have team members use the feature and provide feedback on readability and usefulness
   - Test in different terminal emulators to ensure compatibility
   - Verify the feature works in terminals with limited color support

6. Performance Testing:
   - Measure rendering time for large projects
   - Ensure reasonable performance with 100+ interconnected tasks
